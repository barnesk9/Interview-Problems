# Interview Problem

This project is a starting point for ThinkTopic job applicants. The goal is to demonstrate your basic skills with git, javascript, html and a couple other common technologies. This project shouldn't take too much time but feel free to make it interesting. Whether it's js skills, python on the backend or compelling CSS and design, try to demonstrate your skills as best as possible.

All the resources needed should be included in this project as well as references to documentation for all of the technologies used.

### Background

The client has tasked us with creating a music album management tool to view and organize albums. The client has a database of album information including album titles, artist names and other information. To start, they want to be able to view all the albums stored on the server. Ideally they could sort and/or filter the Albums or view individual albums.

### Directions

- Using the provided API file to access the album information stored on the server, update the app.jsx code to show the information from the backend
  + Implement a componentDidMount method to load the albums
  + Update the Album component to show useful information about each Album
- If you complete that and are happy with the results show us some other skills you have by extending the project to meet more of the client's needs

### Running the project

Run the API server app with:

`python app.py`

You can then navigate to [the running app](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to begin development.

### Submission

Submit your results to `join-us@thinktopic.com` as a .tar.gz. This submission should include:
  - The entire project in a directory
  - An additional directory titled `docs`
  - Your resume or CV as well a project write up. The write up should include
    + What you've done
    + How you may improve your solution
    + Any relevant documentation that you feel would be helpful as if you were handing off the project to someone else to work on in the future.
    + Your background and familiarity with the technologies used
    + Your feedback - was this fun, could it be better?
